# Infernal-Arms
Infernal Arms allows the player to use three of Zagreus' heralded weapons from the 2018 release Hades created by Supergiant Games within Terraria. Stygias, the Blade of the Underworld, Coronacht, the Heart-Seeking Bow, and Varatha, the Eternal Spear, are all able to be crafted from different celestial fragments in order to do what they were destined for: Kill a god.
